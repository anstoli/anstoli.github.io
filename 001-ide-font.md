# Best IDE font

I am using GoLand and other IntelliJ IDEs for my day job and personal projects.

So far, I find **SF Mono** to be the best editor font and **SF Pro Display** is looks nice for menus and other UI elements.

Both fonts can be downloaded for free at https://developer.apple.com/fonts/

## Install on MacOS

1. Go to Applications > Utilities folder
2. Right click on Terminal > Show Application Contents
3. Go Contents > Resources > Fonts
4. Select all SF-*.otf files at once > CMD-O (Open).
5. Import all.
